The decision of whether or not to break-up with someone at any given time can probably be expressed as a polynomial (i.e. `ax^i + by^j + cz^k + ...`) where the coefficients (`a`, `b`, ...) are the weights of how important the factors (`x`, `y`, ...) are to the individual (for simplicity, we'll use "you"). That is, if a factor is unimportant to you, it'll have a small coefficient (it plays a small role in determining the outcome). The factors themselves are the difference you percieve between you and your partner on some quality. For example, `x` could be the number of hours difference between when you and your partner go to bed, `y` could be the difference between your and your partner's capacity for empathy, `z` could be the difference between your and your partner's patience, etc. If the sum of all of the terms in this polynomial is greater than some constant, then you feel as though it makes sense to break up with your partner. If it's less than some constant, then you feel as though you should stay with your partner.
