Note: This is currently very free-form because often these are disjoint thoughts that sprang into my mind while I was walking or discussing this topic with friends or strangers and hearing their stories. 

The decision of whether or not to break-up with someone at any given time can probably be expressed as a polynomial (i.e. `ax^i + by^j + cz^k + ...`) where the coefficients (`a`, `b`, ...) are the weights of how important the factors (`x`, `y`, ...) are to the individual (for simplicity, we'll use "you"). That is, if a factor is unimportant to you, it'll have a small coefficient (it plays a small role in determining the outcome). The factors themselves are the difference you percieve between you and your partner on some quality. For example, `x` could be the number of hours difference between when you and your partner go to bed, `y` could be the difference between your and your partner's capacity for empathy, `z` could be the difference between your and your partner's patience, etc. If the sum of all of the terms in this polynomial is greater than some constant, then you feel as though it makes sense to break up with your partner. If it's less than this constant, then you feel as though you should stay with your partner. 

It's likely that all decisions thinking beings make could be represented by a polynomial such as this and comparing it to some constant threshhold (notice what's being explored here is essentially identical to general [classification problems in machine learning](https://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/machine-learning-theory-an-introductory-primer)), but we'll stick with using relationships as a means of exploring the polynomial's ability to represent the way we think.

In addition to the primary terms of the polynomial, we also have "bias" terms which are added in and treated the exact same in our decision making as the fundamental (or sometimes even objective) qualities. These could pull the decision toward (racist views, a stigma against not graduating college, etc) or away (avoiding the pain of separating finances, avoiding dealing with when the lease is going to end and who is going to move out, etc.) breaking up.
