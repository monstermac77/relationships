Note: This is currently very free-form because often these are disjoint thoughts that sprang into my mind while I was walking or discussing this topic with friends or strangers and hearing their stories. 

The decision of whether or not to break-up with someone at any given time can probably be expressed as a polynomial (i.e. `ax^i + by^j + cz^k + ...`) where the coefficients (`a`, `b`, ...) are the weights of how important the factors (`x`, `y`, ...) are to the individual (for simplicity, we'll use "you"). If the sum of all of the terms in this polynomial is smaller than some constant `ψ` (where `0 < ψ < 1`), then you feel as though it makes sense to break up with your partner. If the sum is greater than this constant, then you feel as though you should stay with your partner. The factors are the percieved<sup>1</sup> difference between you and your partner on some quality. For example, `x` could be your partner's attitude toward saving money, `y` could be the number of hours difference between when you and your partner go to bed, `z` could be your partner's capacity for empathy or patience, etc. If a factor is unimportant to you, it'll have a small coefficient (i.e. it plays a small role in determining the outcome).

It's likely that all decisions thinking beings make could be represented by a polynomial such as this and comparing it to some constant threshhold (notice what's being explored here is essentially identical to general [classification problems in machine learning](https://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/machine-learning-theory-an-introductory-primer)), but we'll stick with using relationships as a means of exploring the polynomial's ability to represent the way we think.

In addition to the primary terms of the polynomial, we also have "bias" terms which are added in and treated the exact same in our decision making as the fundamental (or sometimes even objective) factors. These could pull the decision toward breaking up (racist views, a stigma against their educational background, etc.) or away from breaking up (avoiding the pain of separating finances, avoiding figuring out who is going to move out and who will continue paying for the lease, etc.) 

A wonderful benefit of discussing one's relationship with friends, a therapist, or even a stranger is that when they evaluate this polynomial, they are often not subject to (or subject to different but probably less strongly weighted) bias terms. The better they are at being objective/the more training they have in this (e.g. a psychologist), the smaller and smaller weighted their bias terms are. Moreover, the more removed they are from your life (e.g. a stranger) the fewer bias terms they're likely to have since your action will have no effect on them. This permits them with a profound ability to provide very solid advice, but here's the issue: they can't possibly know or experience all of what you've experienced in the relationship. There lies the catch: your friends / therapist aren't subject to your bias terms, but they don't have the complete information; you have the complete information, but you're subject to your bias terms. 

One approach to this issue is documentation: to the best of your ability, document objectively the variety of terms (factors) that you believe come into play for you and how important they are to you (weights), then provide this documentation to as many of your friends as possible and ask them to evaluate whether they think your partner is someone you should stay with. This documentation could come in the form of a written summary of the relationship (long-form), a pro/cons list (short-form), or perhaps something even more quantititative. An equivalent, reduced version of this problem that can be used to good effect is: create only a cons list and check if the sum of the termss is greater than `(1 - ψ)`. Discussing this documentation with as many trusted people as possible is also advised, as it appears merely the process of discussion is essentially an act of "learning" (i.e. an adjustment process on the weights of the factors). This weight adjustment process also appears in machine learning and is revered to as [training a Perceptron](https://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/an-introduction-to-deep-learning-from-perceptrons-to-deep-networks) in supervised learning.

One might wonder then: why doesn't one just always follow the raw advice of their friends? That is another issue: it seems as though it's difficult to make any decision if it doesn't feel like that decision isn't coming from within (likely as a way of protection against undue influence by others). Perhaps this is why the Socratic method or even "reverse psychology"<sup>2</sup> is such an effective form of teaching: it lightly tricks the mind into thinking that it is the origination of the idea or belief, and so that idea or belief can be trusted and acted upon. This is also likely why we often kick ourselves for not listening to others in hindsight once we've discovered that they were right; we simply couldn't make the same conclusion as them before we discovered for ourselves because of our bias terms. In hindsight, the bias terms have gone to zero, which means we have perfect clarity because we have all of the information and none of the bias, so the solution seems obvious (hence the expression "hindsight is 20/20").

Finally, after breaking up, it seems as though one starts to highly (sometimes over) value (or at least notice) the attributes that they felt like were missing from their former partner (that is, they have "learned" and positively adjusted the weights of the these factors in the polynomial)<sup>3</sup>. As mentioned above, sometimes this learning can come from discussion with friends, therapy, or strangers (for an open-minded person). However, there is no substitute for self-discovery when it comes to learning. Over time, random environmental events will trend the factors in the polynomial (which, remember, are the _percieved_ values) toward their _true_ values, just like the law of large numbers says that the percent of heads when flipping a coin will tend toward 50% as the number of flips goes to infinity (in essense: as time evolves, truth emerges). An example of a random environmental event: your partner getting a dream job in another state and having to decide what to choose, you or their career. An event like this is simply an acceleration of what would have been discovered eventually anyway provided enough time and other random (perhaps less consequential) environmental events, such as deciding how much to spend on a new television (which will help uncover the true difference in attitude toward saving money). These acceleration events are undoubtably painful, often for both parties, because it requires a change in perception and can induce anxiety as a concern might grow that the true values of these terms are simply so great that a break-up will inevitably ensue (which of course is anxiety-inducing because of the sunk cost of the relationship, the fear of a now unknown future, etc.). The ultimate acceleration event is being broken up with non-amicably. 

This is  if your partner only gets accepted . Certain events 
either by being broken up with or accelerating the discovery of the true vastness of fundamental difference by random environmental factors (a pandemic, long distance dating, the death of a family member). 

A couple of additional thougts: 
* The constant, which effectively is a threshhold, that the polynomial is compared against is also likely a value that flucuates over time (that is, it's a trainable value). For instance, it's likely that as one ages, this value is adjusted up or down after each relationship. For instance, if it was determined that a relationship went on for longer than it should have, it's likely that this threshold is reduced as an attempt to prevent that from happening again. As one feels pressure to find a partner, either by family or nearing middle life, it's likely that this value is also slowly adjusted upward to allow for a faster discovery of a compatible partner. 
* The honeymoon period can be understood as an early phase in the relationship,  where one has a tendency to percieve that their partner is very similar to them. The length of the honeymoon period is likely inversely proportional to the size of the _true_ differences between all of the factors. That is, as time goes on, these percieved values tend toward their actual true values (via random discovery, often accelerated by hardship and other environmental factors). The larger the actual difference, the faster the honeymoon period will end and trend toward break-up. It's likely reasonable to conclude that no relationship can survive infinite time or substantial, unending environmental hardship. Every relationship likely would end, it's simply a matter of whether one's life ends prior to that period. Random environmental factors likely simply accelerate this timeline. 
* Friendships also likely can be described in this way, although the number of terms is likely much smaller.
* It's good to think about the bias terms as artificial glue that binds two people together. For instance, a marriage contract is exactly this. Marriage more than anything is a tool to stabilize
