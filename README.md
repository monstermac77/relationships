The decision of whether or not to break-up with someone at any given time can probably be expressed as a polynomial (i.e. `ax^i + by^j + cz^k + ...`) where the coefficients (`a`, `b`, ...) are the weights of how important the factors (`x`, `y`, ...) are to the individual (for simplicity, we'll use "you"). That is, if a factor is unimportant to you, it'll have a small coefficient (it plays a small role in determining the outcome). The factors themselves are the magnitude of difference you percieve between you and your partner on some quality.
