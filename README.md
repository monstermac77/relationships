Note: This is currently very free-form because often these are disjoint thoughts that sprang into my mind while I was walking or discussing this topic with friends or strangers and hearing their stories. 

The decision of whether or not to break-up with someone at any given time can probably be expressed as a polynomial (i.e. `ax^i + by^j + cz^k + ...`) where the coefficients (`a`, `b`, ...) are the weights of how important the factors (`x`, `y`, ...) are to the individual (for simplicity, we'll use "you"). That is, if a factor is unimportant to you, it'll have a small coefficient (it plays a small role in determining the outcome). The factors themselves are the difference you percieve between you and your partner on some quality. For example, `x` could be the number of hours difference between when you and your partner go to bed, `y` could be the difference between your and your partner's capacity for empathy, `z` could be the difference between your and your partner's patience, etc. If the sum of all of the terms in this polynomial is greater than some constant, then you feel as though it makes sense to break up with your partner. If it's less than this constant, then you feel as though you should stay with your partner. 

It's likely that all decisions thinking beings make could be represented by a polynomial such as this and comparing it to some constant threshhold (notice what's being explored here is essentially identical to general [classification problems in machine learning](https://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/machine-learning-theory-an-introductory-primer)), but we'll stick with using relationships as a means of exploring the polynomial's ability to represent the way we think.

In addition to the primary terms of the polynomial, we also have "bias" terms which are added in and treated the exact same in our decision making as the fundamental (or sometimes even objective) factors. These could pull the decision toward (racist views, a stigma against not having a college degree, etc) or away (avoiding the pain of separating finances, avoiding figuring out who is going to move out and what happens to the lease, etc.) breaking up. 

A wonderful benefit of discussing one's relationship with friends, a therapist, or even a stranger is that when they evaluate this polynomial, they are often not subject to (or subject to different but probably less strongly weighted) bias terms. The better they are at being objective/the more training they have in this (a psychologist), the smaller and smaller weighted their bias terms are. And the more removed they are from your life (e.g. a stranger) the fewer bias terms they're likely to have. This allows them with a profound ability to provide very helpful advice, but here's the issue: they can't possibly know or experience all of what you've experienced in the relationship. There lies the catch: your friends / therapist aren't subject to your bias terms, but they don't have the complete information; you have the complete information, but you're subject to your bias terms. 

One approach to this issue is documentation: to the best of your ability, document objectively the variety of terms (factors) that you believe come into play for you and how important they are to you (weights), then provide this documentation to as many of your friends as possible and ask them to evaluate whether they think your partner is someone you should stay with. This documentation could come in the form of a long-form written summary of the relationship, a pro/cons list, or perhaps something even more quantititative. Discussing with as many trusted people as possible is advised, because it appears this process is essentially the act of "learning". By talking to others, your weights will likely be adjusted, especially the weights of the bias terms which will likely be reduced simply because others will explicitly not focus on them as factors (again, in machine learning, this weight adjustment process is [training a Perceptron](https://www.toptal.com/machine-learning/an-introduction-to-deep-learning-from-perceptrons-to-deep-networks) in supervised learning).

One might wonder then: why doesn't one just always follow the raw advice of their friends? That is another issue: it seems as though it's difficult to make any decision if it doesn't feel like that decision isn't coming from within (likely as a way of protection against undue influence by others). Perhaps this is why the Socratic method or even "reverse psychology"<sup>1</sup> is such an effective form of teaching: it lightly tricks the mind into thinking that it is the origination of the idea or belief, and so that idea or belief can be trusted. This is also likely why we often kick ourselves for not listening to others in hindsight once we've discovered ourselves that they were right; we simply couldn't see it before because of the bias terms.
